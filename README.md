# Measurement-Device
This is a project from MTE201, University of Waterloo statistics course, in my second year of Mechatronics Engineering. Using statistics methods taught in the course such as uncertainty analysis, our group developed a calibration equation and device using 3D printing, a potentiometer and Arduino to measure object with up to a millimeter of accuracy
